== General


=== About this document
This document is a part of a specification series. Each part specifies the contents of a 
Submodel template for the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). The AAS is described 
in [1], [2], [3] and [6]. First exemplary Submodel contents were described in [4], 
while the actual format of this document was derived by the 
"Administration Shell in Practice" [5]. The format aims to be very concise, 
giving only minimal necessary information for applying a Submodel template, 
while leaving deeper descriptions and specification of concepts, structures and 
mapping to the respective documents [1] to [7].
Common terms and abbreviations can be found in [8].

The target audience of the specification are developers and editors of technical 
documentation and manufacturer information, which are describing assets in 
smart manufacturing by means of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and 
therefore need to create a Submodel instance with a hierarchy of 
SubmodelElements. This document especially details on the question, 
which SubmodelElements with which semantic identification shall be 
used for this purpose.

=== Scope of the Submodel
This Submodel template aims at an *interoperable provision of product change notifications* between suppliers and users of industrial product types and *items*, particularly industrial components. These industrial product types and items are typically provided by *manufacturers* and *suppliers*, including dealers, and used by *industrial users*, e.g. original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), system integrators and producing enterprises (industrial end users). The product types are typically used to provide more than one product instance, however special cases such as mass-customization and engineer-to-order are applicable.

Product types have individual life cycles with individual *life-cycle steps* and *milestones*, which are important to know for industrial users to safeguard and continue their business. The aim of this Submodel is to digitialize and interoperably convey sets of minimal required information and to ease the handover of these information sets (records), to make it possible to efficiently filter, monitor and store this information in software systems on industrial user's side.

The *intended use-case* is, that a manufacturer of industrial produces types and items makes respective product change notifications digitally available in a way, that these are interoperable and unambiguously understood by the other market participants, such as industrial users, including OEMs, system integrators or operators of industrial equipment. 

This Submodel template specifies a basic set of SubmodelElements in order to bring about the necessary information according to this use-case.


=== Relevant standards for the Submodel template
According to [3], interoperable properties might be defined by standards, consortium specifcations or manufacturer specifications. This Submodel template therefore takes up the developments of other standards (see <<Table_relevant_standards>>):

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header", id="Table_relevant_standards", title="Relevant standards for this Submodel template"]
|===
|Standard
|Description

|*IEC 62890:2020-07* — Industrial-process measurement, control and automation - Life-cycle-management for systems and components
|Describes basic concepts of product types and instances and the concepts of a life-cycle mode

|*VDMA 24903* — Obsolescence management – Exchange of information regarding change and discontinuance of products and items	
|Describes important event in the life-cycle of a product type and identifies important information elements to be conveyed

|*IEC 62402:2019* — Obsolescence management
|International standard providing the requirements and guidance for obsolescence management. Taking up the developments from VDMA 24903. IEC 62402:2025 will be formed to a standard series with multiple parts; part 3 will take over the models VDMA 24903.
|===

[NOTE]
This document in this version makes many references to the VDMA 24903. Once all relevant models are taken over to IEC 62402:2025, this document at long last will switch these references to the IEC standard.

So called property dictionaries are used to identify information elements (see Terms and Definitions of [6]). Such property dictionaries include:

•	ECLASS, see: https://www.eclasscontent.com/
•	IEC CDD, see: https://cdd.iec.ch/cdd/iec61987/iec61987.nsf and https://cdd.iec.ch/cdd/iec62683/cdddev.nsf

In this document, properties are aimed to be described by ECLASS.



=== Explanations on used UML diagrams
For clarity and an improved legibility readers are suggested to go through this section at first before reading the following chapters.

The UML diagrams (see <<Example_on_UML>>) feature box-like elements, called "classes". These classes, typically Submodels, SubmodelElementCollections or SubmodelElementLists feature a set of Properties or further SubmodelElements. These elements can have specific cardinalities, e.g. mandatory [1], optionally [0..1], or zero to many [0..\*] or one to many [1..*].

The single classes are hierarchally organized by aggregation relations, these can be seen as "contains" relation.

For a further overview on UML diagrams please refer to [6] and [11]. 

Further details about used table formats please refer to Annex A.

== Approaches


=== Assets
This Submodel concerns about the following assets (see <<Table_assets>>):

[cols="1,1",options="header", id="Table_assets", title="Assets concerned by the Submodel"]
|===
|Asset
|Description

|*Product types*, such as model series of industrial components, systems
|Typical application of this Submodel template. Change notifications from product types to be published.

|*Product instances*, such as sold individual products, industrial components, systems	
|Viable application of this Submodel template. Changes of a one-of-a-kind component, system or machine to be published.
|===

=== Life-cycle models
<<Figure_IEC62890>> and <<Figure_VDMA24903>> show the life-cycle models of IEC 62890 and VDMA 24903, which are also compatible with IEC 62890. The life-cycle of a industrial product type or item is basically framed by *SOP* (start of production) and *EOSR* (End Of Service and Repair). Depending on the individual use-case, different time-intervals and life-cycle events are found to be relevant.

[NOTE]
For some of these milestones, typical deadlines for communication from supplier to users are applicable in specific industrial sectors and markets. These deadlines might be described in a later version of this Submodel template.

The term "product change notification" refers to all of the above milestones, especially also the product discontinuance notice.


=== Relevant information
Various information is expressed in typical product change notification from companies. This includes:

* records of product change notification itself
* details of the change (when, what, why, ..)
* master data of the item provided by the supplier (name, purpose, classification, ..)
* identification of the item, which is subject of the change notification (incl. identification properties, technical properties, logistic information, technical data elements)
* possible subsets of item batches, e.g. range of serial numbers
* identification of item(s), which might be proposed as substitute (incl. identification properties, technical properties, logistic information, technical data elements describing operating ranges)


=== Semantic changes of technical data elements
The `reason` and `item` identification of VDMA 24903 (see section 4.1, 4.2) provide a rather coarse information, that _something_ has changed with respect to these reasons and items. 

To cope with with, the standard and this Submodel template optionally provide files and documents (`«SML» AdditionalInformation`) that give some human-readable information, _what_ has been changed. However, no machine-readable information is given, _what specifically_ has been changed with respect to the item.

This is where the *technical data changes* of this Submodel template add additional machine-readable information: For each `«SMC» Record` and its `«SMC» ItemOfChange`, a list of `«SMC» TechnicalData_Changes` might be added (see <<Figure_Example_scenario>>). These structures identify the technical data element by its `semanticId` and contain new `value` information. Additionally, a *back-reference* to the particular information in the Submodel for technical data can be given, in cases, where the `semanticId` solely is not specific enough.

image::Figure_Example_scenario.png[id="Figure_Example_scenario", width="80.0%",title="Example scenario of a change record 0017 with changed technical data element MaxOutputCurrent, referring back to the origin with in the Submodel for Technical data"]


=== Substitutions and compatibility towards fit, form, function
If the availability of the item of change is going to be limited in the near future, alternative items might be sourced for *product substitution*. In order to pursue this process, the Submodel template allows the promotion of such so called *recommended items*. Each recommended item can potentially be used to substitute the item of change, with a varying degree of suitablility.

This suitablility can only be assessed by the industrial user of the item, e.g. the machine integrator or operator. Therefore, the supplier is able and encouraged to promote multiple possible descriptions of recommended items and to explain the potential suitability by the use of technical data up to a level of sufficient information. The industrial user however is in the position to choose such or another item as substitution.

The benefit for the supplier is to use this channel to promote the optimal range of products to the industrial users. This allows e.g. the promotion of new products with better production costs, a fine-grained portfolio management or to leverage scale effects. Also, the range of preferred series (a.k.a. customer catalogues) can play an important role.

Comparison should follow the well established categories of fit, form, function (see below). The Submodel template allows to provide values for technical data elements (e.g. Properties or Ranges),  both for the actually used item of change (`«SMC» TechnicalData_CurrentState`) and for the recommended items (`«SMC» TechnicalData_(Fit|Form|Function|Other)`). That is, for recommended items, the supplier assigns technical data elements to these 3 categories or other. 

Additionally, an overall percentage (`«Prop» target estimate`) gives a rough indication (see <<Figure_Fit_Form_Function>>). The heuristics for the distinction into fit, form, function and the target estimate lies solely by the supplier of information and is no subject of publication or standardization.

image::Figure_Fit_Form_Function.png[id="Figure_Fit_Form_Function", width="80.0%",title="Example of comparability towards fit, form, function for two recommended sustitutions of a product"]

For the distinction of fit, form, function the following statements are given by [9] (see <<Table_Fit_Form_Function>>):

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header", id="Table_Fit_Form_Function", title="Distinction of fit, form, function [9]"]
|===
|Category
|Description

|*Form*
|The form of a commodity is defined by its configuration (including the geometrically measured configuration), material, and material properties that uniquely characterize it. For software, the form means the design, logic flow, and algorithms.

|*Fit*	
|The fit of a commodity is defined by its ability to physically interface or connect with or become an integral part of another commodity. For software, the fit is defined by its ability to interface or connect with a defense article.

|*Function*
|The function of a commodity is the action or actions it is designed to perform. For software, the function means the action or actions the software performs directly related to a defense article or as a standalone application.

=== Overview UML model
The SubmodelElements described in section 3 are structured in the following way (see <<UML_overview>>):

[plantuml, UML_overview, svg, id="UML_overview", title="UML overview"]
----
include::partial$diagrams/UML_overview.puml[]
----

For the overall Submodel template and its instances, some notes can be given:

* Such Submodel instance consists of multiple records, each of these describing an product change notification (PCN).
* If new notifications occur, records are added to the already existing list `«SML» Records`, typically by adding records with higher numerical index to the list.
* An AAS event element (`«Event» PcnEventsOutgoing`, not shown in overview) serves for emitting AAS events on new PCN records to subscribers.
* Each `«SMC» Record` might feature multiple reasons, why that change notifications occurs, e.g. change of raw materials (`RAWM`).
* Each `«SMC» Record` features a `«SMC» ItemOfChange`, which describes the (industrial) items for which the notifications occurs.
* Such item of change might describe changes in technical data (`«SMC» TechnicalData_Changes`) or might provide technical data for comparison with the recommended items (`«SMC» TechnicalData_CurrentState`).
* If the supply of the changed items stops and substitutes should be described by the supplier, each `«SMC» Record` might feature a number of recommendations (`«SML» RecommendedItems`).
* Such `«SMC» RecommendedItem\__00__` might have another product classification and might describe technical data elements, which differ from the current state of technical data of the item of change. These technical data elements are grouped by fit, form, function or other (not applicable). An example for such group is `«SMC» TechnicalData_Fit`, holding multiple DataElements (not shown).

=== Single PCN record
The following UML model shows the structure and attributes of a single PCN record (see Figure 6).

* By `«SMC» Manufacturer`, the manufacturers legal name and address is given. For the latter, a *SMT dropin* for contact information is used.

* By `«SMC» LifeCycleData`, an update of one or multiple milestone-specific dates of validity might be communicated, e.g. for EOS = end of sales.

* By `«SMC» ReasonOfChange`, one or multiple reason of changes for this single records can be set. That is e.g., the record might communicate, that `LABEL` and `SOFTWARE` led to this PCN.

* By `«SMC» PcnChangeInformation`, human readable text information (e.g. title and text body) extends the understanding of the PCN record. 

* Optionally, human readable file content can be given by a set of files in `«SML» AdditionalInformations`.

* Item specific information is described by `«SMC» ItemOfChange` and by possible `«SMC» RecommendedItem\__00__`.

=== ItemOfChange
The following UML model shows the structure and attributes of the item of change. As sub-structures, product classifications, changes to the technical data by this record and the current state of technical data, compared to the recommended items, are found.

Note: ItemOfChange and RecommendedItem\__00__ use a similar set of SubmodelElements. For the sake of clarity, these structures are described by distinct ConceptDescriptions with clearly identified possibilities and cardinalities.

=== RecommendedItem
If the availability of the item of change is going to be limited in the near future, an alternative item might be sourced. Recommendations from suppliers side are described by such recommended items. The following UML model shows the structure and attributes of such recommended item. As the structure is complex, multiple sub-classes are shown in the UML model. These sub-classes will be described in later sections.

Note: ItemOfChange and RecommendedItem\__00__ use a similar set of SubmodelElements. For the sake of clarity, these structures are described by distinct ConceptDescriptions with clearly identified possibilities and cardinalities.

=== Life cycle data and milestones
When a product change notification record is issued, multiple important milestone dates according section 2.2 might by altered by the supplier. In order to bring about the update of these dates, `«SML» LifeCycleData` can be populated by multiple `«SMC» Milestone` structures. For each of these structures, a milestone classification (see Table 2) and a new date of validity is provided.

The date of validity specifies, when the item enters a new life-cycle phase. The record's `«Prop» DateOfRecord` documents, when the change was available for public access.

For this information structure, two tables are given. The first describes the list of milestones (life cycle data), the second describes the individual milestone. The table convention is explained in Annex A.2.

=== Item categories
Items might be categorized either as a whole or with their affected sub-parts to allow (semi-) automatic assessment of the PCN by the industrial users.

Theoretically, multiple classifications of this item categorization can be done. However, at least one categorization according VDMA 24903 shall be given.

For this information structure, two tables are given. The first describes the list of item categorizations, the second describes the attributes of a single categorization. The table convention is explained in Annex A.2.

=== Affected part numbers
Even if a specific combination of product family and product designation are given, tens of thousends of manufactured products might be affected by a product change notification. Often, the supplier wants to limit the extent of such PCN further, for example to a certain batch or producing factory.

Therefore, the Submodel template allows listing of affected part numbers. This listing is *only required*, if *not all* part numbers specified by product family and product designation are affected.

Multiple list elements can be given, each specifying a set of affected part numbers by using wildcard and delimiting characters.

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",title="Using wildcard and delimiting characters for affected part numbers"]
|===
|List element value
|Description (example)

|12345
|Single 5 digit part number given.

|12345;23456;34567
|Set of part numbers, coding exactly 3 part numbers, each with 5 digits.

|10000-19999
|Range of part numbers; all 10000 part number combinations with 5 digits starting with a '1' are affected.

|1*8
|Asterix wildcard, can be used in single/ set/ range part numbers. Will express all numbers starting with '1' and ending with '8'.

|1?3?8
|Question mark wildcard, can be used in single/ set/ range part numbers. Will express all numbers all 5 digit numbers starting with '1' and ending with '8' and middle as '3'.

=== Changes of technical data (Variant A)
----
The structure of annotating changes of technical data by references is still discussed.

This is Variant A.
----

When a product change notification is given, it might be relevant, which technical data element of the item of change have actually changed and to which reason of change this contributes. This information structure is able to hold this information, including the approach to express the respective semanticId and value of this technical data element. Additionally, an  backreference to the respective (updated) element in the Submodel for technical data, where the changes originates, can be provided.

For this information structure, two tables are given. The first describes the list of reasons of change, the second describes the attributes of a single reason. The table convention is explained in Annex A.2.

== Annex A.	Explanations on used table formats

=== 1. General

The used tables in this document try to outline information as concise as possible. They do not convey all information on Submodels and SubmodelElements. For this purpose, the definitive definitions are given by a separate file in form of an AASX file of the Submodel template and its elements.

=== 2. Tables on Submodels and SubmodelElements

For clarity and brevity, a set of rules is used for the tables for describing Submodels and SubmodelElements.

* The tables follow in principle the same conventions as in [5].
* The table heads abbreviate 'cardinality' with 'card'.
* The tables often place two informations in different rows of the same table cell. In this case, the first information is marked out by sharp brackets [] form the second information. A special case are the semanticIds, which are marked out by the format: (type)(local)[idType]value.
* The types of SubmodelElements are abbreviated:

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header"]
|===
|SME type |SubmodelElement type
|Property |Property
|MLP |MultiLanguageProperty
|Range |Range
|File |File
|Blob |Blob
|Ref |ReferenceElement
|Rel |RelationshipElement
|SMC |SubmodelElementCollection
|===

* If an idShort ends with '\__00__', this indicates a suffix of the respective length (here: 2) of decimal digits, in order to make the idShort unique. A different idShort might be choosen, as long as it is unique in the parent’s context.
* The Keys of semanticId in the main section feature only idType and value, such as: https://admin-shell.io/vdi/2770/1/0/DocumentId/Id. The attribute "type" (typically "ConceptDescription" and "(local)" or "GlobalReference") need to be set accordingly; see [6].
* If a table does not contain a column with "parent" heading, all represented attributes share the same parent. This parent is denoted in the head of the table.
* Multi-language strings are represented by the text value, followed by '@'-character and the ISO 639 language code: example@EN.
* The [valueType] is only given for Properties.
